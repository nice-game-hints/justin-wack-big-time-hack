Uggah, goh gah ^[ Kloot needs to learn to talk. ]

# Gaguh?
Come again? No, I think we need to use English for the hints.

# Yeah, that is a good idea
So, Kloot needs to learn to talk. Maybe he could read _a book_ and learn that way.

## What book?
Explore the office and try to find a book. ^[ There is a diary in the trash bin in Justin's cubicle. ]

Use the diary and Kloot will start to talk English.
