order: 43
---

There is a communication device near **Justin**'s cell.

# I can't reach it
You need something to reach farer. But you can grab the can of sardin, though.

# I have the sardin, what about it?
Did you notice the reaction you grabbing the can?

# What reaction
The cave man in the next cell smelled it.

## What should I do?
Give the can of sardines to the caveman.

# The caveman is out
Can you now reach farer? ^[ Grab the butterfly net. ]

## I guess so
Grab the butterfly net and use it to get the communication device from the table.
