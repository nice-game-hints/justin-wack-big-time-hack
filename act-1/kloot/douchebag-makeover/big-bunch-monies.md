To get the makeover you need one big bunch of monies.

# Where do I get that?
Have you spotted anything expensive-looking?

## What is expensive looking?
The guitar [at the pub](../get-into-pub.md).

You can win [the expensive-looking guitar](../expensive-guitar.md).

# I have the guitar
Nice, maybe the pawnshop would trade it for a big bunch of monies.

# He just offered me something else
A shovel. Hmm.. could that help, though?

## How does the shovel help?
Well, there was that patch of soil in the park. Where the dog digged.

Trade the guitar for a shovel and dig from the soil in the park.

# The shovel!
Ohhh... how annoying. The dog seemed interested in the spot.

# What about the dog?
Orion is good at burying things, like _bones_ and such.

## What should I do?
Give a chicken bone ^[ You find one from the trash bin near the pub. ] to the dog Orion. She will bury it into the soil.

You get a real diamond! That much be worth a bug bunch of monies.

## What should I do with the diamond?
Go trade it for cash in the pawnshop.
