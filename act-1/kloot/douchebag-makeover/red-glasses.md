One part of the Douchebag makeover is red glasses.

First, you need just plain glasses. ^[ Check out the barber and his client. Grab the glasses from next to her. ]

# I have the (non-red) glasses
Now, make them red.

# How can I make them red?
Spill some red sauce on them.

## Where do I find that red sauce?
In [the pub](../get-into-pub.md).

## What red sauce are you talking about?
Use the ketchup bottle on the glasses. Now you have red glasses.
