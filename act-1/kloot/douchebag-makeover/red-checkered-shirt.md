One part of the Douchebag makeover is red checkered shirt.

# Can't find a shirt
And the ones in the fashion shop are wrong color. You could _make_ a shirt.

# Make, I would need some cloth
Look closely for red checkered cloth. ^[ In the [pub](../get-into-pub.md). ]

## What cloth do I need?
Take the red checkered table cloth from [the pub](../get-into-pub.md), near the piano.

## Okay, I have the cloth
Now, cut a shirt out of it. ^[ Use the scissors you stole from the barber on the tablecloth. ]
