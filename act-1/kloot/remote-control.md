---

There is a remote control on the table next to the jukebox [in the pub](get-into-pub.md).

# It has no batteries
Did you find any other device with batteries?

# Any hints on that device?
You find it here, in the pub.

## What item am I looking for?
Take the guitar pedal from the stage. Click on it in the inventory and you have a pair of batteries.

Use the batteries on the remote control.
