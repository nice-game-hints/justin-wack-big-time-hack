The television set is not working in the pawnshop. I think it is missing [a remote](remote-control.md).

# I have a working remote control
But then you would need something to show on the television set.

## What should I show?
Videos, for example. ^[ Grab a VHS from the shelf left from the entry. ]

## What video should I show?
Check out the VHS about Van Halen. Take the video cassette and insert it into the slot. Use the remote on the television to turn it on..
