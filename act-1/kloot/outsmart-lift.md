title: Outsmart that lift...
order: 15
---

The lift won't let **Kloot** use it. First of all, [he needs to talk English](learn-talk.md).

# Geguh... I mean, that is not a problem
Okay, but the lift's million megapixel camera is too sharp and notices Kloot is not an employee.

# Million megapixels?
Yeah, _pixels_. If it would see... let's say... less pixels?

# Less pixels?
You notice Kloot has pixels covering his... you know.

# Oh, true!
Maybe you could cover him with something else? ^[ Pick up the apron from the kitchen. Use it Kloot to cover him. ]

## Kloot is covered
And you have some pixels in the inventory. Use the pixels on the lift control to fool it.

# The pixels would just fall off...
Maybe find some sticky stuff to keep them in place?

## What sticky stuff?
Grab the tape roll near the computer. Combine the tape with the pixels. You can now use the taped pixels on the lift control to fool it.
