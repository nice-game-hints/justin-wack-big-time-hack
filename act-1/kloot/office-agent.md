title: Get past the agent in the office
order: 40
---

The Pythonic Empire agent came looking for **Kloot** at the office. He keeps guard at the lift.

# How do I get past the agent?
I think all the agents are part of some kind of transmission network that spans over time.

## Okay?
Did you spot the communication device near **Justin**'s cell? [Grab it.](../justin/comm-device.md)

# I have the communication device
Now you can send distress signals to all agents.

# What should I send?
You could tell Kloot is _already_ out of the building, but that doesn't work.

Maybe you should pry some more info about the agents.

## Like what?
As **Justin**, talk to the agent guarding the prison cell. Talk to him until you learn that he is _ruthless_.

# Okay, they are ruthless
Maybe you can now come up with a story. ^[ Send a distress signal about the new episode of "Agent Ruthless". ]
