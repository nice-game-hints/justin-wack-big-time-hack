Chugging is the style of guitar play especially used in heavy metal.

# Heavy metal?
There is a heavy metal dude playing his guitar on the street corner. Ask him!

# His string snapped
Oh, what a luck. Maybe you should get him [a replacement string](../guitar-string.md).

# I have the wire
Give it to the dude. You learn how to chug.
