You could learn blues style just by _listening_ some blues, you know?

# Listening?
Like, with a cassette tape with blues music on it.

# Where do I find a cassette tape?
Cassette tapes are old stuff. Something you find in _pawnshops_.

# There is a pawnshop!
Right! Go check their cassette demo selection. ^[ Near the counter. ]

# I found something?
You got the Butch's Blues Bunch cassette demo? Cool!

# Where can I play the cassette?
Did you do your job, already?

# My job?
You are the _waiter_ in [the pub](get-into-pub.md), right?

Serve the food on the counter to the guy with the suit. ^[ Remember to add some salt into the food, first. ]

# He got some food, alright
Yeah, and they blamed _Salty_... Who is now outside on the streets.

# Poor Salty
Yeah, staying on the streets listening his _boombox_.

## Wait a minute!
Boombox! Play the blues cassette tape on the boombox next to Salty.

He shows you some slow and souly air guitar blues riffs.
