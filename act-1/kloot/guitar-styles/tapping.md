Tapping is the style of guitar play that Van Halen made famous.

# Van Halen?
Yeah, old songs on video. Something you find in _pawnshops_.

# There is a pawnshop!
Right! Go check their VHS selection. ^[ Left from the main entrance. ]

# There is a Van Halen VHS!
Great! Take it and play it on the VCR.

## But the television has no power button!
You would need [a working remote control](../remote-control.md). Use the remote control on the television to play the video and learn the technique.
