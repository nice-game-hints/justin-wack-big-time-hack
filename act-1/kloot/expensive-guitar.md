There is a really expensive-looking guitar in the pub.

It is the prize for the air guitar contest. You just need to master the [three guitar styles](guitar-styles/index.md) to win it.

# I am ready for the contest
Go forward with Justin until the air guitar contest is launched. Then you can just walk into the bar.

# How did the three styles go?
You can revisit your teachers.

## Just tell me the combinations
Okay, here goes. The rounds are in random order. Listen to what the announcer says:
 - Heavy... Chugging, which requires a good scowl.
 - Lot of hands... Tapping, which is so technically demanding...
 - Nice and soulful... Blues, which is so soulful...
