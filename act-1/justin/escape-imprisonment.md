title: Escape imprisonment
order: 20
---

Justin is captured by that Pythonic Empire agent.

# What should I do?
Have you contacted with the cave man? I think he reacted to you picking something up. ^[ Pick up the sardines on the table right from the cell. ]

## What should I do with the caveman?
Grab the sardines from the table and give the can of sardines to the caveman. You can now grab his butterfly net.

# How does the net help me escape?
With the butterfly net you can reach farer.

## What should I reach for?
Grab the communication device from the table using the net.

# How does the comm device help Justin escape?
Not Justin, just now. But Justin can interfere with the time Kloot is in.

**Kloot** should try to get through [the lift control](outsmart-lift.md), first.

# Kloot fooled the lift
And now the other agent is looking for him. [Help Kloot.](office-agent.md)

# The agent is out, but Justin is still in
You have now more stuff to talk with the agent guarding Justin.

# Like what?
Ask if we would like to be in a show. Say that he is ruthless. You learn his serial number is QP-42.

# Serial number, eh?
Yeah, use that comms device. ^[ Report about faulty unit with serial number QP-42. ]

# It destroyed
And the hat flew there.

## What about the hat?
Grab it. Click it in the inventory and you have a pin. Use the pin on the padlock to unlock the cage.
