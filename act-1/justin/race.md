title: Teach those biker guys a lesson
order: 84
---

The biker guys are boasting about their bike.

The other guy is just repairing his bike. He would need [some extra wood](extra-wood.md).

# He got some extra wood
If you now ring the bell they will start the "race".

# The race is not going so well...
The shape of their wheels isn't really optimized for racing.

# How can I change the shape?
If you would find a device that you can use to shape rock. That would be cool.

## Where do I find that device?
Did you [open the hatch with the big rock](bigrock.md), already?

## Yes, I am in the space ship
There's the [emergency phaser](emergency-phaser.md). You just need to [calibrate it](calibrate-phaser.md), first.

# I have the phaser ready and calibrated
Use the phaser to make the race work.

## Use the phaser on what?
Use the phaser on the wheels to make them round.

# The bike is still not moving
Give it a push. You get a special twig as a trophy.
