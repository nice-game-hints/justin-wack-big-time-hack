As you have [the place for the trap](trap-place.md), you should prepare the remote triggering mechanism.

# How can I remotely trigger it?
I think the most usual way to remotely trigger a trap is with some kind of rope.

## Where do I get a rope?
There's vines on the space ship. You can use those.

# But the vines don't work on their own
I think you should attach some kind of a twig on to the vines.

# Where do I get a twig?
You will get it eventually. Go forward with other things.

## Tell me what thing to solve
[Give a lesson to those racers.](../race.md)

# I have a twig!
Congrats! Combine the twig with the vines.

You have a trap-trigger contraption. Prepare [the bait](trap-bait.md).
