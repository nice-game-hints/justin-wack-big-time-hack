You can read the field notes on catching a rabbit at the vegan daycare.

Field notes on catching a rabbit: It seems traps can be constructed using bait and something to hold the bait in place, combined with some sort of remote triggering mechanism.

Here's the instructions:
 - [Find a good place for the trap](trap-place.md)
 - [Prepare a bait](trap-bait.md)
 - [Build a remote triggering mechanism](trap-remote.md)

# I have all of these
Combine the two contraptions and put the trap into the space ship hatch.

# The rabbits are not coming
And you tried the mating calls? Do you know [the correct one](mating-call.md)?
