To trap a rabbit you need a good place for the trap.

# What could be a good place to catch a rabbit?
Have you seen rabbits jumping around? You could try for suitable place by putting the bait ^[ carrot ] on it.

# More hints?
As Daela said, you should "hatch" a plan.

## "Hatch"?
Set your rabbit trap into the space ship hatch. Remove the [big rock](bigrock.md), first.
