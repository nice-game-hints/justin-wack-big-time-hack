order: 50
---

Justin is not strong enough to lift the big rock on top of the hatch.

# He is an IT guy
Yeah, but IT guys can get strong, too.

# How?
By exercise, of course. ^[ There is a father and son practicing weight lift. ]

# How can I exercise?
Go to the gym area, there ought to be something.

# I can't lift the stones
Don't start from the heaviest weight.

## How should I lift the stones?
Start from the smallest. When you lift the biggest you can take on the world! And the big rock on top of the hatch.
