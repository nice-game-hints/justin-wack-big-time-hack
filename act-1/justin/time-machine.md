There is a time machine in [the space ship](bigrock.md).

It works by sitting on it and something running on the hamster wheel.

# What should I get to run on the wheel?
Some small animal is probably the best.

## What animal?
[Catch a rabbit.](catch-rabbit/index.md)

Put the rabbit into the hamster wheel to start the time machine.
