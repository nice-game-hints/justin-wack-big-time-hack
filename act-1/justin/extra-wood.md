The one familiar-looking caveman is building a bike. He is just missing some wood.

# Where do I get more wood?
Have you found other cavemen? ^[ There are a group at the willow. Right from the rock thingy. ]


# I found a group
There's three cavemen at the willow, right from the rock thingy. They are heating a cauldron. You could think they also have some spare wood.

# How can I get the food?
Maybe you could drive them away.

# How can Justin drive a group of cavemen away?
It doesn't have to be Justin. What are they cooking by the way? ^[ Use the cauldron. ]

## Rabbit!
Wait! Are they allowed to eat meat? Go tell the vegan daycare dino about them. She will take care of them.

# She was angry
And the group is gone. They left some scrap wood, the broken ladder, that you can use as extra wood.

# What was I doing with the extra wood?
Give it to the guy repairing his bike. He is now ready to race.
