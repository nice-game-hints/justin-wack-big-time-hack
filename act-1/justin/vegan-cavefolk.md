The dino at the vegan daycare is worried if there are caveman who are parting from the vegan path.

# Vegan path
They are not supposed to eat meat. But are they really obeying that?

# What place should I examine?
The willow. ^[ It is right from the rock thingy with the outhouse. ]

# I found a bunch of cavemen
They are heating a cauldron. What is in the cauldron? ^[ Touch the cauldron. ]

# Oh no!
There's a rabbit! That is not vegan. Go tell the vegan daycare dino!
