One ingredient for the cat curing allergy potion is a cup of hot camomile tea.

Do you have [a camomile flower](camomile.md), already?

# I have a camomile, how do I make the tea?
So, you would need to heat some water and the infuse the flower there, right?

## Tell me where to look for hot water
Go to the vegan daycare. There's a pot of _cold_ water and coals beneath it.

I think you have to [light the coals](../fire.md).

# The water is boiling
Good. Now, infuse the camomile flower in the water.

# The whole flower won't work
_Grind_ the flower, first. There's some grinding equipment nearby.

## Where?
There is a mortar in the shack. Use the camomile flower on the mortar to grind it.

Use the grounded camomile on the hot water to make the tea. You can put the tea into the mug you have with you.
