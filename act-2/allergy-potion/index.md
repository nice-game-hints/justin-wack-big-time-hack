title: Allergy potion
order: 46

After talking to Dr. Abraxas you learn about the potion that will cure cat allergy.

It only has 103 ingredients! Nice to have a little different from those usual three-ingredient puzzles.

Oh, the doctor already has hundred of them... Well, you still should get the three ingredients:
 - A sample of [fur from a cat](cat-fur.md)
 - [Hot camomile tea](hot-camomile-tea.md) to mix up the brew
 - A touch of [space dust](space-dust.md)

When **Justin** has all of these, go talk to Dr. Abraxas.
