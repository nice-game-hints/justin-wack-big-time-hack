For some touch of space dust, I think you need to go to _space_...

# How can I go to space?
You mean how **Justin** can go to space? He would need to shoot himself _high_ enough.

# Okay, interesting...
As soon as you get to [the mountain top](../dodo/index.md) you find one way to shoot up.

## What way is that?
There is a tree stump that looks like _a slingshot_.

# Oh, so use the slingshot to..
.. shoot **Justin** into the space. Exactly!

# How can I shoot him?
You need the sling. **Justin** will find some _slinking_ stuff that can be used when exploring places.

## Where do I find those?
Break into [the hunting lodge](../hunting-lodge.md). ^[ Search through the red bowls under the table. ]

# I have the slinkosaurus intestines!
Use the intestines ^[ Actually, you should use the _stinkosaurus_ intestines ] on the slingshot tree.

Off you go!

# Game over...
Did Justin just launch into space without any means of getting back?

You should use the other intestines, also ^[ Use the slinkosaurus intestines on the next tree stump. ]

# The helmet is broken!
[Fix the space suit.](../space-suit.md)

# The space suit is fixed
Now you should succeed with the space flight.

# Yeah, but Justin's fingers are too short!
Oh, you need one more item. [A bigger hand!](../foam-finger.md)

# I have the bigger finger!
Now you should have everything to grab some space dust.
