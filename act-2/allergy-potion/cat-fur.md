One ingredient for the cat curing allergy potion is a sample of cat fur.

# Where do I find a cat?
I think **Kloot** is in the best position to find cat fur.

## Where should I look for?
In the pawnshop. ^[ Check out the shelf with the blue pet carrier. ]

# I found some cat fur
There is some cat fur in the carrier, indeed. But the owner would want some money for it.

Although you really don't have to buy the whole carrier. You only need some fur.

# Any hints?
Use som item on the carrier to collect the fur that is all over the carrier. That fur stuff _sticks_ to everything.

## What item should I use to collect cat fur?
Use the roll of tape ^[ There is a roll of tape in the office. ] on the pet carrier.
