In a toilet, I presume?

There is a toilet, remember?

## Where is the toilet?
At the willow in the past. Though it is occupied.

# Is there other place for privacy?
How about the next best thing?

## What is that?
Go to the place in the shade. Right from the toilet.

Be sure to have the "container" ^[ The mug ] with **Justin**.

# He needs a cup of coffee
There was a place with a coffee pot. You haven't visited that place for a while.

## What place?
Go to the underground lair with platform. There is a coffee pot. Use the mug on the coffee pot to get a mug of coffee.

**Justin** can now visit the place in the shade to get the sample.
