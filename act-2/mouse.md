> Lake: To get him to come out at all these days, we need to tempt him with some proper mouldy cheese...

There is a white mouse in the maze at the Pythonic Labs.

**Justin** could get it.

# I would like to get that mouse, please
Did you try to offer the cheese to it?

# The mouse doesn't like the cheese
A mouse, who doesn't like cheese? Weird.

It is an lab experiment, would someone know more about the mouse? ^[ Go ask Lake about the mouse and the cheese issue. ]

# The mouse likes only mouldy cheese
You have to get [some mouldy cheese](mouldy-cheese.md) for it.

You can catch the mouse with the mouldy cheese.

## What should I do with the mouse?
It is a rodent, smaller than a rabbit. ^[ Use the mouse on the time machine hamster wheel. ]
