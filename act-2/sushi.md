If you try to grab Sushi the fish the kid will yell at you.

# What should I do to the kid?
Maybe if you find him some tasks to do you could grab Sushi.

# What tasks?
The shop looks clean. So there's no cleaning tasks...

# Should I make a mess?
Maybe, that dry spot on the floor is really dry...

## What should I do to the dry spot?
Make it wet. Pour some liquid on to it.

# What liquid?
Something in the mug.

## Tell me what liquid to pour on the spot
Pour some [hot camomile tea](allergy-potion/hot-camomile-tea.md) on the dry spot.

You can now grab Sushi to go.

# What should I do with Sushi?
Set him into a _bigger environment_?

## Where should I put Sushi?
Into the fountain near the pawnshop.
