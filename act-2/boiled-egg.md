title: Boiled egg
order: 92
---

Salty would like to eat a soft-boiled [egg](egg.md).

# I have an egg!
Great, now boil it.

# How do I boil it?
Explore with **Justin**. You should find a place to cook. ^[ There is a pot and coals in the vegan daycare. ]

# I found a pot and coals
But the coals are not lit up. [Light the coals up](fire.md) and you have some boiling water.

# The water is boiling
Put the dodo egg into the boiling water. You have a cooked egg.

Go give the egg to Salty.

# Salty can't break the egg
You need to cut the top of the egg off. With something sharp, _deadly sharp_.

## What sharp should I use on the egg?
Cut the egg with the shard of glass that **Justin** can [grab](shard-of-glass.md).

The egg is ready for Salty.
