> ...: Did you just pick up a shard of glass? With your bare hands?

There is a shard of glass in front of the porthole, in the past.

If **Justin** picks it up, it's game over!

# How can I pick the shard up?
Not with your _bare hands_, that's for sure.

# What should I do?
Maybe try to find some protection for you hands, first.

# Where?
Not where, but also, when! Have you traveled to the future, already? With [the rabbit](/act-1/justin/catch-rabbit/index.md)?

# Yeah, I can travel in time!
Good, you will find your protection from the future.

## What should I look for?
There's a pair of sticky gloves in the rubbish bin at the park.

Use the sticky gloves to pick up the shard of glass.
