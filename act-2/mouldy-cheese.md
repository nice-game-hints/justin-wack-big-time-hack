title: Mouldy cheese
order: 60
---

> Lake: Back in those days, people used to store their cheese in damp earth cellars to get them to go mouldy... It took a LONG time, though...

**Justin** needs some mouldy cheese, but there aren't any left in the future.

# Where would I get some mouldy cheese?
Moulding a chees would take a _long time_.

# More hints?
This is a time-travelling game, right?

# What should I do with the cheese, then?
Send the cheese back to **Kloot**. Maybe he can "send" the cheese back to Justin moulded.

# Kloot has the cheese, now
Now, **Kloot** should put the cheese somewhere damp, and earthy, where Justin can find in the future.

## Where should I put the cheese?
There's that patch of soil in the park. It should be damp enough.

# How do I dig the soil?
Yeah, you don't have the shovel anymore. Can someone help you? ^[ Like, Dino? ]

## Who should help me dig the soil?
Orion, the dog. Give him a bone ^[ **Justin** will find a bone at the Python Lab "museum". Take Bob's bone. ].

# There is a hole in the soil!
Put the cheese there to let it mould properly.

# I can't just put the cheese in there without a protection!
So, you need to protect the cheese? What would help with that? Any cheese-related items in your inventory?

## Tell me how to protect the cheese
Put the cheese into the cheese tray ^[ You find the cheese tray from the pub. ], first. Then put the cheese tray into the soil.

# The cheese is in the soil
Now, as **Justin** go dig ^[ Use the sand shovel] the extremely mouldy cheese out.
