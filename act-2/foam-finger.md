title: Foam finger
order: 59
---

There is an interesting foam finger at the pawnshop.

# The owner wants monies for it
I think [a coin](coin.md) would be enough.

# I have a coin but it is not enough
I didn't mean _enough for the foam finger_, but enough to [start saving](saving-money.md).

# I got money!
Transfer the money to **Kloot** and buy the finger from the pawnshop.
