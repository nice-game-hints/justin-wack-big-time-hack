The dude and the pug are telling you about the way to save money.

You should put [a coin](coin.md) into the envelope ^[ The dude will give the envelope to you. ].

# I have an envelope with a coin in
Now it only needs the address.

## Whose address is it?
Justin's, of course. He will get the monies!

## How do I get Justin's address?
Justin has his business card. It has all the details.

**Kloot** should put the business card into the envelope and put it into the mailbox.

# How can I withdraw the money?
Well, it started from a coin. _In the future_ it should be a lot more money.

## What should I do?
As **Justin** go to the ATM and use the hand scanner.

You now have a medium-sized bunch of monies!
