title: Blowing the seashell
order: 44
---

**Justin** has the seashell horn. Wouldn't it be cool to blow into it.

# But Justin's lungs are not big enough
You would need to build some kind of blowing device.

## Where should I build that?
Enter Dr. Abraxas's [hunting lodge](hunting-lodge.md).

# I am inside the hunting lodge {#bear}
There's the bear skin. Use that.

# What should I do the bear skin?
Did you try to put the seashell into its mouth?

# It doesn't fit
Like with any _instrument_, you need something to fit the mouth.

## What should I use on the bear's mouth
Put a mouthpiece ^[ **Kloot** can find a mouthpiece in the pub. ] into the mouth, first.

# The mouthpiece is on
Now, insert the seashell horn on the mouth with mouthpiece.

# How can I blow it, then?
You should fill the bear's lungs with air.

## How do I fill the bear's lungs?
Use the bellows ^[ You find the bellows from the willow. ] on the bear's mouth.

# The bear is filled
Jump on the bear to make the big sound.

# Hmm... the dodo scared?
Yup. By using the bear you can get [past the dodo](dodo/index.md).
