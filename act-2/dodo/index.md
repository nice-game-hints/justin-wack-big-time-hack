title: Passing the dodo
order: 77

> Justin: I bet the dodo sticks its head down that hole when it's scared... Good thing that the hole is empty...

The dodo is protecting the way into the mountain, and its eggs.

# What should I do to the dodo?
Did you notice the hole in the ground in front of it?

# What about the hole?
The dodo sticks its head into the hole when [it is scared](scaring-dodo.md). Luckily, for the dodo, the hole is empty.

# I can scare the dodo
And it sticks its head into the hole?

What if the hole wasn't empty?

## Tell me what to put into the hole
The rock, of course.

Put the rock into the hole and go blow [the seashell horn](../seashell.md).
