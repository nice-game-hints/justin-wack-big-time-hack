title: Scaring the dodo
---

> Dr. Abraxas: I know it's easily spooked by loud noises. Makes it stick its head down that empty hole. I remember it being really scared of the loud roar of a bear I once hunted. I keep the bear-skin in my hunting lodge.

The dodo will stick its head into the hole when it is scared.

# How can I scare the dodo?
Go talk to Dr. Abraxas about it.

Check out the signpost icon in this guide to remind what Dr. Abraxas had to say about this.

# A bear?
There's the skin of the bear in [Dr. Abraxas's hunting lodge](../hunting-lodge.md).

# I am inside the hunting lodge
That bear skin gives me an idea. How about building a really [scary noise-making contraption](../seashell.md#bear) from the bear skin, to scare the dodo.

It will stick its head into the hole.
