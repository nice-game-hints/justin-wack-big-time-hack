title: Wipe out cat allergy once and for all!
order: 130
---

After visiting DR-13 and giving him the [urine sample](urine-sample.md) **Justin** should take care of the cat allergies for all!

# What does that mean?
Travel to the past and make sure cats don't grow fur, ever again.

# How can I do that?
You know what animal cats are descendants of?

## What animal?
Tigers. There's a tiger in the past. ^[ At the shack of Dr. Abraxas. ]

# What should I do to the tiger?
Make it lose its fur. You know, _inverted_ fur growing.

# Inverted?
InvertaTron did just become ready!

## What material should I invert?
Hair growth cream, of course. ^[ **Kloot** will find hair growth cream from the barbershop. ]

# I have anti-hair-growth cream
Now, apply it to the tiger in the past. Directly into its blood stream.

## How?
Use the syringe you find from the doctor DR-13's office.

# I need a safe distance
Use a blow gun.

## Blow gun?
Put the syringe into the bamboo stick and use that on the tiger.
