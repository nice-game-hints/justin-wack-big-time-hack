title: The drone watching Sven
order: 85
---

You can't make "business" with Sven as long as that drone is watching.

# How do I get rid of the drone?
Try to find where it is controlled from. You will see image of Sven somewhere else.

## What is that place?
On the third floor of Python Labs. You can see Sven on one of the monitors.

The agent won't let you touch the controls. Go forward with other stuff until the agent leaves.

# The agent is out
Great, now you can use the terminal.

## What should I do with the terminal?
Utilities -> DronMan.exe -> Check for drone firmware updates -> Update drone firmware
