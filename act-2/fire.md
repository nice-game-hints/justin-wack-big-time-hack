So, you need to fire up some coals? ^[ At the vegan daycare. ]

# Yes, where to start?
You would need to find a _firemaker_. ^[ There's a flame thrower at the alley in the future for **Justin** to grab. ]

# I have the thing but it doesn't have fuel
Get some [fuel into the flame thrower](fuel.md).

# The flame thrower is fueled up
When starting coals you need to soak them with some flammable material.

Do you happen to have any _flammable liquids_ with you?

## What should I use on the coals before the flame?
Use hair spray ^[ **Kloot** finds this from the barbershop. ] on the coals before lighting them up.

# The coals are not hot enough
You need to blow to the coals to make the hotter.

## Blow the coals with what?
Use the bellows ^[ **Justin** can find bellows from the willow. ] on the coals to make them hotter.
