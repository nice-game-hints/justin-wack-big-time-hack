order: 34
---

Dr. Abraxas's hunting lodge is locked tight.

# How can I enter it?
How about outside? There is a window in.

# It would need something strong to bend the bars
Have you [traveled to the future](/act-1/justin/time-machine.md), already?

# Yes, I can travel in time
You find a helpful too from the future.

## What tool should I use?
Take the crowbar from the pile of junk at the alley.

Use the crowbar on the window to get into the hunting lodge.
