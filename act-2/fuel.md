You need some fuel?

Look closely the future with **Justin**.

## What am I looking for?
There's that old red car junk with a petrol cap.

# How do I suck the fuel out of there?
Some kind of a _straw_ would be handy? ^[ Use the bamboo stick on the patrol cap. ]

Other option is to fill some sucking and blowing device with fuel ^[ Fill the bellows with fuel. Use the bellows on the flame thrower. ]

## What am I filling with the fuel?
Get the flame thrower from the alley and fill it with petrol.
